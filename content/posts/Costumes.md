## Costume Inspiration

Jen and Madey have put together a costume mood board for the numbers. Please use these words and images as inspiration for your outfits for the different songs. 

We do have a small budget for costumes, so check your closets and let us know ASAP if we will need to look into purchasing items for you. Just note that any purchases made will then become property of the Everett Theater, following the show. 

If you have any questions or wish to have your outfits approved, please reach out to Jen or Madey. We have divided the numbers up, so if Jen staged the number then you may reach out to her with questions. If I choreographed the number, please reach out to me.
