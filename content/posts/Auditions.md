## ABOUT THE SHOW 

The Everett After Dark Cabaret is a chance to perform a variety of show-tunes that are intended for a mature audience. A small company of performers will be chosen to perform group numbers and a small number of solos from adult-themed Broadway shows like Six, Cabaret, and Spring Awakening. We are looking for 10-20 charismatic theatrical performers, aged 14+, with a preference for more mature performers.

**PERFORMANCE DATES** 
August 11, 12 7:30PM


## IMPORTANT AUDITION INFORMATION: 

Auditions will be held on two dates. You may attend either date at any time during the time-block. You only need to audition once.

**Auditions**
Saturday May, 20 (2:00 PM – 5:00 PM)
Monday, May 22 (6:00 PM – 9:00 PM)

Auditions will be at the Everett Theatre on 46 West Main Street, Middletown, DE.  Please look for signage to the registration area. 

There will be no call-back auditions.

## CONSENT FORM - REQUIRED FOR ALL

All auditioners are required to fill out and submit a consent form. Auditioners under 18 require parent/guardian signature on that form.

[Consent Form can be downloaded here.](../doc/After-Dark-Cabaret-Consent-Form.pdf)

## For auditions, be prepared to…

Perform 16-32 bars of a theater performance that is on-theme. For example, Mein Heir from Cabaret, All You Wanna Do from Six, or Say No To This from Hamilton. We expect to be busy during auditions, so we cannot accept auditions longer than 32 bars, which is normally 1 minute. No accompanist is available so you may either sing acapella or bring a backing track to connect to our bluetooth speaker.

Learn and perform a brief dance audition. Our choreographer will teach a short combination to small groups.

Provide any conflicts between May 29th and August 12th that would prevent you from attending rehearsals on weekday evenings and any time during weekends.

If you are under 18, provide consent from a parent/guardian. This is required due to the adult themes and language of the material we will be performing. Performers should expect to be exposed to profanity, as well as sexual and violent themes.


## Video Auditions

We highly recommend you attend in-person auditions. For those that cannot, you may email video submissions to the following email address: everett.cabaret@gmail.com . All video submissions should be submitted by 11:00PM on May 21st. Videos should include 16-32 bars of a vocal performance, as well as demonstration of your dancing ability. For example, 1 minute of movement to your favorite song from Rent. You should also provide any conflicts you have between May 29th and August 12th that would prevent you from attending rehearsals on nights and weekends. All auditioners are required to submit the consent form (link above).
