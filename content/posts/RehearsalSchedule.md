Our rehearsals are Mondays and Thursdays from 6:30-9:30 and Saturday afternoons. 

The rest of the schedule is below. We are still working out who will be called when. Keep an eye on this page as it adjusts.

The times are rough estimates but we will do our best to honor them. Arrive 5-15 minutes before your song call-time so you're ready to go, since some of the turnaround times are fast.

*** RECENT CHANGE: Moved big spender choreo from 6/19 to Monday 6/26 at 8:00. 
Removed You're the One That I Want from 6/26 ***

*** 6/24 is currently being reworked. Keep an eye here and on your email in case you are called ***
