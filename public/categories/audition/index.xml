      <description>Trying to pick out the perfect audition song for our cabaret? Here is a preview playlist of songs we have chosen for the show and are looking to cast. Feel free to pick something from this list, or bring something of your own! Weâ€™re looking for performers to cast into prechosen group numbers. We will likely add a handful more to this list, inspired by auditions.
