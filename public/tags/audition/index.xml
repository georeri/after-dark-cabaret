      <description>ABOUT THE SHOW The Everett After Dark Cabaret is a chance to perform a variety of show-tunes that are intended for a mature audience. A small company of performers will be chosen to perform group numbers and a small number of solos from adult-themed Broadway shows like Six, Cabaret, and Spring Awakening. We are looking for 10-20 charismatic theatrical performers, aged 14+, with a preference for more mature performers.
